## 🎯 Project Overview
An end-to-end machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as **spam** or **ham** using NLP and achieving **97.58% accuracy** with Support Vector Classifier.

## 🚀 Key Results
| Algorithm | Accuracy | Precision |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **SVC** | **97.58%** | **97.48%** |
| Random Forest | 97.39% | 98.26% |
| Extra Trees | 97.49% | 97.46% |
| Naive Bayes | 97.10% | 100.00% |
| XGBoost | 96.81% | 94.87% |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, XGBoost
- **NLP**: NLTK (tokenization, stemming, stopwords)
- **Data Analysis**: Pandas, NumPy
